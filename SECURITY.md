If private advisory reporting is unavailable, contact the maintainers before opening any public issue.
Do not post exploit details in public issues or pull requests.

## Disclosure Policy

1. We validate the report and assess severity.
2. We prepare and test a fix.
3. We coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter when possible.
4. We publish the fix and advisory once users have a reasonable update window.

For critical issues under active exploitation, mitigation guidance may be published before a full fix is available.

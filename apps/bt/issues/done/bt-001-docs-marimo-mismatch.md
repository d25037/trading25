# bt-001 Docs: Marimo migration mismatch

## 目的
Update documentation to reflect Marimo-based execution and XDG output paths (not Papermill, not notebooks/generated).

Current docs still reference Papermill/Jupyter and legacy output locations, which causes confusion and incorrect usage.

## 受け入れ条件
- Docs mention Marimo execution system and current output directories (XDG paths).
- All Papermill/Jupyter references are either removed or clearly marked as legacy.

## 実施内容
- README.md
- docs/commands.md

## 結果
（完了済み）

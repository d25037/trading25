This directory is retained for backward compatibility only.

Canonical skill definitions are managed at:

- `<repo-root>/.codex/skills`

Rules:

- Do not edit files under `apps/ts/.claude/skills/*`.
- Additions/updates must be made under `root/.codex/skills`.
- Legacy aliases are provided in `root/.codex/skills` for migration safety.

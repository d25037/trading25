/**
 * Golden Dataset Generator — DEPRECATED (Phase 3.5)
 *
 * Previously generated indicator golden datasets from TS implementations.
 * TS indicator functions (sma, ema, macd, ppo, atr, bollinger, etc.) have been
 * deleted as part of the apps/bt/ API migration.
 *
 * Golden JSON files in golden/ directory are pre-generated and used by apps/bt/ Python
 * tests directly. Re-generation is no longer needed from TS side.
 *
 * If golden datasets need to be regenerated, use apps/bt/ Python test infrastructure.
 */

console.log('Golden datasets in golden/ are pre-generated.');
console.log('Use apps/bt/ Python tests for golden verification.');

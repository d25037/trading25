# Contracts

This directory defines stable interfaces between `apps/ts` and `apps/bt`.

## Policy
- Treat contract changes as versioned changes (additive vs breaking).
- If a breaking change is required, create a new versioned contract file.
- Keep contracts implementation-agnostic; no internal details.

## Files
- `dataset-schema.json`: Minimal dataset snapshot schema expected by `apps/bt` (legacy v1).
- `dataset-db-schema-v2.json`: Dataset DB schema contract aligned with `apps/ts` Drizzle tables.
- `backtest-run-manifest-v1.schema.json`: Backtest run manifest emitted by `apps/bt`.
- `strategy-config-v1.schema.json`: Strategy YAML schema validated by `apps/bt`.

## OpenAPI Snapshots (Referenced)
- `apps/ts/packages/shared/openapi/bt-openapi.json`: `apps/bt` OpenAPI snapshot used for type sync.
- `apps/ts/packages/api/openapi.json`: `apps/ts` OpenAPI snapshot generated by the API server.
